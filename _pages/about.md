I am a Computational Linguist and an incoming postgraduate in MPhil in Linguistics by thesis at the University of Cambridge. I am currently in my final year at the University of Oxford, reading Psychology, Philosophy, and Linguistics. 

My research interests are centred around computational analyses of language: I look into what we can find out about language from large-scale analysis of textual and speech data. I am especially interested in modelling language, using geometric deep learning to analyse language in context, and resolving cognitive tasks and related problems, such as entity recognition. 

I aim see how language processing differs between humans and machines and to understand what kind of biases are exhibited by language models to eventually look at what we can infer from that about language structure.
