I am a Computational Linguist and a postgraduate at the University of Cambridge. My research is focused on cognitively-motivated and socially-responsible Natural Language Processing.

My current work involves aligning language models with the computations and representations of the brain processing language. I analyse how the architecture of the language processing system differs between humans and machines. Through this, I aim to understand how modifying the structure of neural networks underlying language models can make them more accurate, responsible, and sensitive across diverse communities.
