I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Christ’s College, University of Cambridge, specialising in Natural Language Processing. My research is focused on cognitively-motivated and socially-responsible NLP systems built in a way that emulates brain-level language processing mechanisms. I am supervised by <a href="https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/people/Fermin-Moscoso-del-Prado-Martin">Dr Fermín Moscoso del Prado Martín</a>, Associate Professor in Computational Linguistics at the <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science and Technology of Cambridge University</a>, the department at which I am based and by which I am funded.

My current work involves aligning language models with the computations and representations of the brain processing language. I analyse how the architecture of the language processing system differs between humans and machines and how we can modify the structure of neural networks underlying language models to make them work like the brain. Through this, I aim to understand how to make language models more accurate, responsible, and sensitive across diverse communities.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my MPhil in Linguistics (by research), also at Cambridge University. My thesis was on the <a href="https://przemekkubiak.github.io/portfolio/brain-llm-convergence/">convergence between a transformer-based sentence encoder and neural activity in the brain</a>. I was advised by <a href=“https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/">Nigel Collier</a>, Professor of Natural Language Processing. Prior to my master’s, I did my BA degree in Psychology, Philosophy, and Linguistics at University College, University of Oxford.
