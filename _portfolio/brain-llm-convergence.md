title: "Language Models and the Brain: Convergence"
excerpt: "Analysing the architectural and functional similarity between the brain and a langauge model."

This project attempts to shed light on the differences and similarities between the brain and language models by identifying which components of a language model appear aligned with various regions in the language network. Specifically, this is analysed by comparing the sensitivity of components of a language model and brain regions to specific linguistic features. The research direction is guided by the hypothesis that if a component of a language model and a brain region are more aligned, they exhibit similarities in the kind of linguistic features they attune to. By analysing data from a neuroimaging study of Wehbe et al.(2014) and the representations of the SentenceTransformers (SBERT) language model (Reimersand Gurevych, 2019), I attempt to answer the following research questions:
<ul>
  <li>RQ1. What components of the language modelare most aligned with brain regions?</li>
  <li>RQ2. What components of the language modelare least aligned with brain regions?</li>
  <li>RQ3. What does the alignment between the language model and the brain tell us about howthey process language?</li>
</ul>

The analysis of this study resulted in a finding that the components which are most aligned with specific brain regions are: embeddings from the final layer of SBERT (with right-hemisphere supramarginal gyrus), embeddings from the 2nd layer (with the triangularis in the right-hemisphere inferior frontal gyrus) and embeddings from the 5th layer (with the orbitalis in the right-hemisphere inferior frontal gyrus). The weakest alignment is observed for the attention heads from the first layer and for the triangularis in right-hemisphere inferior frontal gyrus. The overarching conclusion is that the alignment analysis unveils that SBERT is less sensitive to discourse-level structures than to syntactic structures, while the reverse is true for the brain.
